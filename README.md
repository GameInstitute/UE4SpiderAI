UE4 Spider AI

Source Code to go with blog http://www.mike-purvis.com/?p=223 UE4 How to make Spider AI. 

The source is provided under the MIT open-source license and you can do whatever you want with it. 

The assets are privately held at this point, the artist who made them holds the license. They are very boxy right now. If the project is successful we will look at doing proper models and anmitations to go with this, and submit it to Unreal Tournment.
